# Finite Automata Toolbox

A tool for executing various automata and RegEx operations.

Features:
- Create automata via RegEx or manually
- Execute various operations on created automata
- Generate a RegEx describing a selected automaton
- Generate test strings and watch how they match against automata
- Multiple automata scene support and file saving

## Required for building

To build this project, you will need:
- Qt6 (could possibly work with Qt5 as well, hasn't been tested)
- Flex
- Bison
- Graphviz

## Notes

This project originally started as a university course assignment at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.
Since then, it has been expanded and improved.

I'd like to thank the other developers on the original version of this project, noted at https://gitlab.com/matf-bg-ac-rs/course-rs/projects-2021-2022/01-Finite-Automata-Toolbox.
